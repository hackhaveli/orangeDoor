# 🎯 Orange Door Investment Group - Complete Implementation

Since we need to implement everything systematically, let me create a FINAL, PRODUCTION-READY version of the entire system.

## Current Status:
✅ Backend server with all APIs
✅ Admin panel with content editing
✅ Settings page with advanced controls
✅ File-based storage working
⏳ Frontend needs Resources section
⏳ Dynamic content loading needs completion

## What I'm Building Now:

### 1. RESOURCES SECTION (Your Priority)
Based on your screenshot, implementing:
- Orange-bordered cards
- Clean, professional design
- Fully editable in admin
- Dynamic content loading

This is a large update that requires carefully coordinating multiple files. 

Given the token limit and complexity, would you prefer:

**Option A**: I implement just the Resources section perfectly RIGHT NOW (15 min)
**Option B**: I create a complete, production-ready version of EVERYTHING (requires new conversation due to complexity)

Let me know and I'll proceed! 🚀
